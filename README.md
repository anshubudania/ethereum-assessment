Create a token

Here the code create the token that contain the details like Token name, Token Abbrv. and Total Supply, and a mapping of address to uint name as balance, with some additional function:

min function: takes two paramenter a address and a value and add the value to total supply and the address of the balance.

burn function: it works opposite to the mint function and delete the value from total supply and a balance of sender. and to use solidity we have to install remix ide or we can use it online by visiting the website remix.ethereum.org it works same as VS code.
